# ImageSplitter
Splits Image Horizontally. My first C++ project, isn't the best code but usable.

# Usage
Drag and drop an image file on the ImageSplitter.exe, and enter how many segments you want the output to have. A new directory will be created for the output in the same folder as the input image.
